🃏 Blackjack in Python
Welcome to a simple text-based Blackjack game written in Python!
Challenge yourself to beat the dealer (called "Mana") by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over.

🎮 How It Works
The game uses a simplified deck of 52 cards (A, 2–10, J, Q, K).

You and "Mana" (the dealer) are each dealt cards.

Aces can count as 1 or 11, and face cards (J, Q, K) count as 10.

You choose whether to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (end your turn).

The dealer follows a simple AI that may or may not draw another card based on random choice and current score.

The closest to 21 without going over wins!

📋 Features
Custom input to treat Ace as either 1 or 11 for player.

Dealer draws cards based on simple logic.

Basic win/loss logic implemented.

Interactive text-based gameplay using the console.
